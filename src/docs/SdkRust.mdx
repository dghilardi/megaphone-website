## Rust Client

Use the `megaphone-client` crate to interact with the server from your Rust applications.

<div className="bg-black/50 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">

```rust
use megaphone::client::{MegaphoneClient, model::StreamSpec};
use futures::StreamExt;

// Initialize client
let mut client = MegaphoneClient::new("http://localhost:3080/read", 100);

// Subscribe to a stream
let mut msg_stream = client.new_unbounded_stream::<_, _, _, Payload>(
    initialize_channel
).await?;

while let Some(msg) = msg_stream.next().await {
    println!("Received: {:?}", msg);
}
```

</div>
