## Architecture

Megaphone acts as a buffer and streaming bridge. The architecture is built around a decoupling of **Producers** (your backend services) and **Consumers** (frontend clients).

  <Card title="Producers">
    Write messages to a specific channel address via simple HTTP POST requests. They don't need to know if a client is connected.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consumers">
    Connect to a channel via a long-lived HTTP GET request (streaming). They receive messages in real-time.
