# Introduction

Megaphone is a high-performance reverse proxy designed to
simplify real-time communication between microservices and
frontend clients.

<Callout title="Why Megaphone?">
  It abstracts the complexity of handling long-running requests and server streaming. Instead of every microservice managing WebSocket connections, Megaphone handles the "last mile" delivery to clients, allowing services to simply POST events when they happen.
