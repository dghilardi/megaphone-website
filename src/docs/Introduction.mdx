simplify real-time communication between microservices and
frontend clients.

  <h4 className="text-blue-400 font-semibold mb-2">Why Megaphone?</h4>
  <p className="text-gray-300 m-0">
    It abstracts the complexity of handling long-running requests and server streaming. Instead of every microservice managing WebSocket connections, Megaphone handles the "last mile" delivery to clients, allowing services to simply POST events when they happen.
