## Channels

Channels are ephemeral communication pipes.

- **Buffering:** Each channel holds a buffer of 100 messages. If a client disconnects briefly, messages are saved.
- **TTL:** Channels automatically delete after 1 minute of inactivity (no reads/writes).
- **Security:** Channels are identified by random UUIDs, acting as capability tokens.
